Collaboration Protocol: InAs-Al Fabrication

Requirements

Material: InAs-Al Wafers (Mobility > 40k).

Geometry: 3-Terminal Wire with 30nm Middle Probe.

Validation: Must pass TGP (Gap Reopening @ 0.4T).

Braid Sequence

Partners must integrate the Aletheia FPGA V3 Controller to execute the (s1 s2 s1')^4 s3^2 sequence using 5.5ns adiabatic pulses.
